Utility for downloading youtube songs


Uses the hotkey combination Ctrl+Shift+Alt+D to dispatch a python script. It gets the text in the clipboard, checks if the string is a youtube URL, and if it is, it uses [pafy](https://github.com/mps-youtube/pafy) to download the video as mp3 straight into the user's music folder.

Potentially the C++ part can be used to execute any function based on any hotkey.
